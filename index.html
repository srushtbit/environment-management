        <strong>What is Water Pollution?</strong>
        <br>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies by harmful substances, affecting both wildlife and
        human health.

        <br>2.Agricultural Runoff: Pesticides and fertilizers wash into rivers and lakes.
        <br>3.Sewage: Untreated wastewater from cities pollutes water sources.
        <br>4.Plastic Waste: Single-use plastics harm marine life and water quality.
        <br><strong>Effects:</strong>
        <br>1.Ecosystem Damage: Harmful to aquatic plants and animals.
        <br>2.Health Risks: Contaminated water can cause diseases.
        <br>3.Economic Impact: Affects fisheries, tourism, and local economies.
        <br><strong>What Can We Do?</strong>
